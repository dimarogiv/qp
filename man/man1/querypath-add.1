.SH NAME
\fBquerypath-add\fR - add a new directory or increment its rank
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B querypath add [PATHS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the directory is not already in the database, this command creates a new
entry for it with a default score of 1, otherwise, it increments the existing
score by 1. It then sets the last updated field of the entry to the current
time. After this, it runs the \fBAGING\fR algorithm on the database. See
\fBquerypath\fR(1) for more about the algorithm.
.sp
If you'd like to prevent a directory from being added to the database, see the
\fB_QP_EXCLUDE_DIRS\fR environment variable in \fBquerypath\fR(1).
